🚀 Excited to Share My New Data Analyst Agent App 📊

I’ve been working on an exciting project that combines cutting-edge AI and data analysis, and I'm thrilled to finally share it with you all! Introducing my Data Analyst Agent App built using Streamlit, OpenAI, DuckDB, and Pandas.

🔍 What does the app do? This app is designed to empower data analysts (and enthusiasts) to:

Upload datasets (CSV or Excel files).

Perform interactive data queries using natural language.

Automatically generate SQL queries using AI and get real-time insights.

Visualize results with a variety of charts (bar charts, scatter plots, etc.).


The app utilizes OpenAI’s GPT model for natural language processing, DuckDB for SQL queries, and Pandas/Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. It simplifies the data analysis process, making it easier for non-technical users to work with data!

⚙️ Key Features:

File Upload: Upload CSV/Excel files and preprocess them.

AI-Powered Querying: Ask any query in natural language, and the app will generate the corresponding SQL query.

Data Visualization: Instantly generate visualizations from your data.

History: Keep track of past queries and responses.


📈 Tech Stack:

Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web apps.

OpenAI: Natural Language Processing to generate SQL queries.

DuckDB: In-memory SQL database engine for fast querying.

Pandas & Matplotlib: Data analysis and visualization.

💡 Why this project?

With the power of AI, this app makes data analysis more accessible and less intimidating. It’s a great tool for anyone looking to get insights from their data without needing extensive programming knowledge.
